Leaf Disease Detection App

This is an application developed using Machine Learning and Python. This project was developed using Android Studio. I used Java programming for front-end development and Python programming for back-end development. It is a simple user friendly android application where the user can upload image of a diseased leaf and the application will identify and display name of the disease.
I have used a dataset containing around 20,000 images classified into 15 classes. The accuracy of the model is 89.27%.
I would also like to extend this project in the future by connecting to database and when the user uploads image of diseased leaf, the application will identify the disease and display name of disease identified as well as few remedies taken from trusted sources.
